## Overview
The Mobile Bus Ticketing System (MBTS) is a digital solution designed to modernize and streamline the bus ticket purchasing process. This system allows passengers to book and pay for bus tickets remotely using their mobile devices, eliminating the need for physical queues and reducing time wasted at stations. Built with Oracle Database and PL/SQL, it provides real-time seat availability, secure transactions, and automated reservation management.


## Problem Statement
The traditional bus ticketing process requires passengers to physically visit stations or agents, leading to long queues, wasted time, and uncertainty about seat availability. This system creates inefficiencies, inconveniences travelers, and poses security risks in crowded environments. The MBTS addresses these challenges by providing a digital platform for convenient, secure, and efficient ticket booking.
