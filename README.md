## Overview
The Mobile Bus Ticketing System (MBTS) is a digital solution designed to modernize and streamline the bus ticket purchasing process. This system allows passengers to book and pay for bus tickets remotely using their mobile devices, eliminating the need for physical queues and reducing time wasted at stations. Built with Oracle Database and PL/SQL, it provides real-time seat availability, secure transactions, and automated reservation management.


## Problem Statement
The traditional bus ticketing process requires passengers to physically visit stations or agents, leading to long queues, wasted time, and uncertainty about seat availability. This system creates inefficiencies, inconveniences travelers, and poses security risks in crowded environments. The MBTS addresses these challenges by providing a digital platform for convenient, secure, and efficient ticket booking.

## Key Objectives
1. **Enhance Passenger Convenience** - Enable remote ticket booking and payment via mobile devices
2. **Increase Operational Efficiency** - Eliminate physical queues and reduce waiting times
3. **Provide Real-Time Information** - Offer transparent visibility into bus schedules and seat availability
4. **Improve Security** - Reduce cash handling and minimize risks in crowded environments
5. **Ensure Data Integrity** - Implement robust database constraints and business logic using PL/SQL
